# steady-state-PM-Synchronous-Machine
A (Permanent Magnet) Synchronous Machine is a 3-phase motor/generator which converts between electrical and rotational power like the DC machine. Unlike the DC machine, this machine uses/generates 3-phase power. The machine generates a constant rotor magnetic field which aligns with a rotating stator magnetic field. This field is generated with *3\*N* coils at an angle of *120/N* degrees from each other. 

Here, *N* is the number of pole pairs of the motor. This is demonstrated below, in a motor with three coils, and so has 1 pole pair.

Since the fields are always aligned, the speed of the rotor can be precisely controlled. For a 3-phase signal with synchronous frequency *f*, the rotational speed of the motor *Ï‰_s* is

The torque equation is unfortunately harder to derive than this. For this, we will again look at the machine in a purely functional way, as a circuit with a perfect conversion between electrical and rotational power and an armature resistance. Also included is a synchronous inductance which is included because of the phase shift resulting from the fact we are working with AC currents. The full derivation will not be given in this explanation. 

As with the DC machine, there is also in the Synchronous machine a conversion constant between the developed torque and the current. This can be seen as the linked magnetic flux through the stator windings. This is denoted as a lambda.
